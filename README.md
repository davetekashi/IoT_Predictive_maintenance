This is a machine learning model that predicts the failure of IoT devices in Industry 4.0.
This is useful for companies and industies who use IoT devices to know when a device will experience failure or not and also the kind of failure that will occur at a particular instance

Them algorithms used were machine learning algorithms and the deep belief network(DbN)
The predictive_main.ipynb is the python file I trianed the machine learning models.
The test.ipynb is the python file I trained my dbN model.
